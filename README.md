# windows-tetris-wallpaper

Some crappy C++ code using the windows API and SDL2, together with a poorly coded and not very performant implementation of tetris, that enables you to play tetris on your wallpaper (if you're actually using Windows 10).

Use this at your own risk :)

## Compilation

- VS 2022 (C++)
- tested on Windows 10 Pro Build 19044.1466

## How this accident happened

This project was a challange from my older brother, he told me to complete in a bit under 2 days. I thought I'd take it, why not learn something new.. So soon after that, I read a blog post, dug into the MS docs and after one day of copy-pasting some Windows API magic into my code, I didn't really have the time (and desire) to to think about performance and cleaning up this mess.
